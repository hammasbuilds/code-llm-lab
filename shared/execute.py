"""Run a candidate solution against a task's tests, in a separate process with a timeout.

Shared by every project in this lab, because the thing that makes a code benchmark
reproducible is not the prompt - it is the execution rule. How code is extracted from a
model response and how it is run decides the score more than the model does.

Outcomes stay separated rather than collapsing into pass/fail:

- `pass`    - all tests held
- `fail`    - an assertion failed, the honest way to be wrong
- `error`   - any other exception
- `timeout` - did not finish

`fail` and `error` both count as rejected, but only `fail` means the tests actually tested
something. A candidate caught by crashing would have survived behind a guard clause.
